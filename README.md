# Make Commits Matter

A way of using version control and developing software.


## The Idea

The number of commits of a repository is usually considered on the high hierarchy of version control.
However, there is a difference between making commits like `"spelling fix"` and `"added feature X"`.
While every commit is indeed important and none should be discouraged, **this is purely based on preference**.


## The Build

1. A README badge (shield) that displays number of commits that matter.
2. A `git` _"plugin"_ that would check how much a commit matters.

This will be according to a threshold on commits stats (calculated using addition and deletion).
